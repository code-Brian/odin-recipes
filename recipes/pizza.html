  <p>Every once in a while I get a craving for a non-tomato sauce, or 'white' pizza.</p>
  <p>
    'New pizza ideas' is always a popular food wish, and I hope this ricotta spread 
    inspires lots of pizza experimentation in your kitchen.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup fresh asparagus, trimmed </li>
    <li>&frac12;cup ricotta cheese </li>
    <li>&frac14; cup olive oil </li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, or to taste </li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
    <li>2 tbsps heavy cream </li>
    <li>2 tbsps chopped herbs, such as basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme</li>
    <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
    <li>1 tbsps flour, for dusting</li>
    <li>&frac12; cup diced smoked ham </li>
    <li>&frac12; cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese </li>
    <li>1 tbsps finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an oven to 550&#8457; (285&#8451;).</li>
    <li>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add asparagus and cook uncovered 
      until just tender, about 2 minutes. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse 
      in ice water for several minutes. Once asparagus is cold, drain well and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combine ricotta, olive oil, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, black pepper, and heavy cream
       in a small bowl. Stir in fresh herbs and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      To shape the pizza dough, sprinkle the countertop and dough surface with flour and lightly 
      pat flat. Use a rolling pin to form a thin disk about 9 inches in diameter. Transfer to a 
      baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spread ricotta mixture over crust, top with ham and asparagus. Sprinkle with Cheddar and 
      Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place baking sheet on the bottom rack of the preheated oven and bake for 5 minutes. Transfer
       the baking sheet to the top rack and bake for an additional 5 minutes.
    </li>
  </ol>
