    Porkchops with a glossy apple cider glaze is really easy.
  </p>
  <p>
    While there's no starch or extra butter involved, it reduces quickly 
    to a thick, rich, sweet-tart apple syrup.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>6 (6oz each) boneless center-cut porkchops</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp butter</li>
    <li>3 cloves minced garlic</li>
    <li>&frac14; cup apple cider vinegar</li>
    <li>2 cups apple cider</li>
    <li>1 tsp Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1 tsp minced rosemary</li>
    <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Season pork chops with salt and black pepper.</li>
    <li>
      Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. 
      Cook pork chops in the hot oil mixture until browned on both sides 
      and pork is slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
      An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145&#8457; (63&#8451;).
      Remove pan from heat; transfer porkchops to a plate.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir garlic into the pan and place over medium-high heat; cook and stir for 30 seconds. 
      Pour in vinegar and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add apple 
      cider and Dijon mustard, bring mixture to a boil and cook until sauce is reduced and 
      thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rosemary and red pepper flakes; season with salt and black 
      pepper to taste.
    </li>
    <li>Return pork chops to the pan to warm slightly, 1 to 2 minutes per side.</li>
  </ol>
